# Templates
This contains the templates for stuff.

  You shouldn't need to download the repository. Just copy-paste the text from the template you need into a new file in the other 
repository. I'll be explaining how this works better to you guys later.

C = Character
  - A player's character
P = Player
  - The actual person (the player)
R = Race
  - Races, duh
H = Path
  - Basically classes, but not limiting
T = Path Category
  - Categories for paths -- eg| such-and-such path is a healing-oriented path, so it fits into the 'Healer' category
